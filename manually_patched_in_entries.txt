The tasks are 1-D pole balancing. Several programs incorporating learning have already achieved this (1, S, 8): the problem is to move a cart along a short piece of track to at to keep a pole balanced on its end; the pole is hinged to the cart at its bottom, and the cart is moved either to the left or to the right by a force of constant magnitude. The form of the task considered here, after (3), involves a genuinely difficult credit-assignment problem. We use a learning scheme previously developed and analysed (1, 7) to achieve performance through reinforcement, and extend it to include changing and new requirements. For example, the length or mast of the pole can change, the bias of the force, its strength, and so on; and the system can be tasked to avoid certain regions altogether. In this way we explore the learning system&#039;s ability to adapt to changes and to profit from a selected training sequence, both of which are of obvious utility in practical robotics applications.The results described here were obtained using a computer simulation of the pole-balancing problem. A movie will be shown of the performance of the system under the various requirements and tasks.","url":"https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/ijcai/ijcai85.html#SelfridgeSB85","lang":null,"authors":[1997216218,2120464764,2305505430],"fos":[119857082,154945302,67203356,2777275308,2986914688,34413123,41008148],"journals":[],"conferences":[2793897755],"conference_series":[1203999783],"references":[38913427,1488252886,1970185999,2091565802,2138178898,2895239407],"filter_matches":["trainingtrackingrobotics"],"rank":20103,"citation_count":98,"estimated_citation_count":149,"publication_date":"1985-08-18","found_in":1},

In this paper I consider a class of sequential decision tasks (SDTs), called composite sequential decision tasks, formed by temporally concatenating a number of elemental sequential decision tasks. Elemental SDTs cannot be decomposed into simpler SDTs. I consider a learning agent that has to learn to solve a set of elemental and composite SDTs. I assume that the structure of the composite tasks is unknown to the learning agent. The straightforward application of reinforcement learning to multiple tasks requires learning the tasks separately, which can waste computational resources, both memory and time. I present a new learning algorithm and a modular architecture that learns the decomposition of composite SDTs, and achieves transfer of learning by sharing the solutions of elemental SDTs across multiple composite SDTs. The solution of a composite SDT is constructed by computationally inexpensive modifications of the solutions of its constituent elemental SDTs. I provide a proof of one aspect of the learning algorithm.","url":"https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4615-3618-5_6","lang":"en","authors":[2102570927],"fos":[2992882098,154945302,28006648,2988947689,150899416,11866591,2988486947,119857082,97541855,41008148],"journals":[62148650],"conferences":[],"conference_series":[],"references":[1253821906,1491843047,1500024457,1545148916,1557517019,1586172133,1640247718,1931792391,1979071892,1979500821,1996847178,2001729196,2035446426,2060587510,2091565802,2100677568,2110415190,2135630072,2135995262,2150884987,3011120880,3017143921],"filter_matches":["cse"],"rank":18877,"citation_count":245,"estimated_citation_count":425,"publication_date":"1992-05-01","found_in":1},

We explore solutions to transfer learning within reinforcement learning through the use of spectral methods. Proto-value functions (PVFs) are basis functions computed from a spectral analysis of random walks on the state space graph. They naturally lead to the ability to transfer knowledge and representation between related tasks or domains. We investigate task transfer by using the same PVFs in Markov decision processes (MDPs) with different rewards functions. Additionally, our experiments in domain transfer explore applying the Nystrom method for interpolation of PVFs between MDPs of different sizes. 1. Problem Statement The aim of transfer learning is to reuse behavior by using the knowledge learned about one domain or task to accelerate learning in a related domain or task. In this paper we explore solutions to transfer learning within reinforcement learning (Sutton &amp; Barto, 1998) through spectral methods. The new framework of proto-transfer learning transfers representations from one domain to another. This transfer entails the reuse of eigenvectors learned from one graph on another. We explore how to transfer knowledge learned on the source graph to a similar graph by modifying the eigenvectors of the Laplacian of the source domain to be reused for the target domain. Proto-value functions (PVFs) are a natural abstraction since they condense a domain by automatically learning an embedding of the Appearing in the ICML-06 Workshop on Structural Knowledge Transfer for Machine Learning, Pittsburgh, PA, 2006. Copyright 2006 by the author(s)/owner(s). state space based on its topology (Mahadevan, 2005). PVFs lead to the ability to transfer knowledge about domains and tasks, since they are constructed without taking reward into account. We define task transfer as the problem of transferring knowledge when the state space remains the same and only the reward differs. For task transfer, taskindependent basis functions, such as PVFs, can be reused from one task to the next without modification. Domain transfer refers to the more challenging problem of the state space changing. This change in state space can be a change in topology (i.e. obstacles moving to different locations) or a change in scale (i.e. a smaller or larger domain of the same shape). For domain transfer, the basis functions may need to be modified to reflect the changes in the state space. (Foster &amp; Dayan, 2002) study the task transfer problem by applying unsupervised, mixture model, learning methods to a collection of optimal value functions of different tasks in order to decompose and extract the underlying structure. In this paper, we investigate task transfer in discrete domains by reusing PVFs in MDPs with different reward functions. For domain transfer, we apply the Nystrom extension for interpolation of PVFs between MDPs of different sizes (Mahadevan et al., 2006). Previous work has accelerated learning when transferring behaviors between tasks and domains (Taylor et al., 2005), but we transfer representation and reuse knowledge to learn comparably on a new task or domain.","url":"http://scholarworks.umass.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1149&amp;context=cs_faculty_pubs","lang":"en","authors":[2010118303,2133778237],"fos":[2777965961,97541855,72434380,150899416,106189395,33923547,154945302,28006648,2776960227,8038995],"journals":[],"conferences":[],"conference_series":[],"references":[194200989,658559791,1515851193,1598748993,2006373179,2032618685,2128905965,2130005627,2143958939,2271263738],"filter_matches":["markovspectral"],"rank":20149,"citation_count":40,"estimated_citation_count":61,"publication_date":"2006-01-01","found_in":1},

Large action sets, however, have received considerably less attention. This paper demonstrates the use of knowledge transfer between related tasks to accelerate learning with large action sets. We introduce action transfer, a technique that extracts the actions from the (near-)optimal solution to the first task and uses them in place of the full action set when learning any subsequent tasks. When optimal actions make up a small fraction of the domain&#039;s action set, action transfer can substantially reduce the number of actions and thus the complexity of the problem. However, action transfer between dissimilar tasks can be detrimental. To address this difficulty, we contribute randomized task perturbation (RTP), an enhancement to action transfer that makes it robust to unrepresentative source tasks. We motivate RTP action transfer with a detailed theoretical analysis featuring a formalism of related tasks and a bound on the suboptimality of action transfer. The empirical results in this paper show the potential of RTP action transfer to substantially expand the applicability of RL to problems with large action sets.","url":"http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/ai-lab/?AAAI05-actions","lang":"en","authors":[183355381,2147180669],"fos":[97541855,119857082,38706069,2776960227,162696548,166109690,154945302,41008148],"journals":[],"conferences":[2785841295],"conference_series":[1184914352],"references":[1515851193,1631187438,1800916125,2041367235,2117341272,2121517924,2121863487,2134153324,2154549708,2155791599,2160279936,3011120880],"filter_matches":["ias"],"rank":19780,"citation_count":62,"estimated_citation_count":93,"publication_date":"2005-07-09","found_in":1},

Here we consider an agent that faces multiple learning tasks within its lifetime. The agent&#x2019;s objective is to maximize its total reward in the lifetime as well as a conventional return in each task. To realize this, it has to be endowed an important ability to keep its past learning experiences and utilize them for improving future learning performance. This time we try to phrase this problem formally. The central idea is to introduce an environmental class, BV-MDPs that is defined with the distribution of MDPs. As an approach to exploiting past learning experiences, we focus on statistical information (mean and deviation) about the agent&#x2019;s value tables. The mean can be used as initial values of the table when a new task is presented. The deviation can be viewed as measuring reliability of the mean, and we utilize it in calculating priority of simulated backups.

We model the distribution over MDPs using a hierarchical Bayesian infinite mixture model. For each novel MDP, we use the previously learned distribution as an informed prior for modelbased Bayesian reinforcement learning. The hierarchical Bayesian framework provides a strong prior that allows us to rapidly infer the characteristics of new environments based on previous environments, while the use of a nonparametric model allows us to quickly adapt to environments we have not encountered before. In addition, the use of infinite mixtures allows for the model to automatically learn the number of underlying MDP components. We evaluate our approach and show that it leads to significant speedups in convergence to an optimal policy after observing only a small number of tasks.","url":"https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=1273496.1273624","lang":"en","authors":[1993564419,2126535395,2139785505,2440006205],"fos":[61224824,191413810,97541855,178980831,71923881,71983512,2776886580,41008148,119857082,154945302,106189395,107673813],"journals":[],"conferences":[2784560012],"conference_series":[1180662882],"references":[1496855202,1515851193,1582436621,1591803298,2039522160,2071814471,2079247031,2080972498,2106953752,2121863487,2128775537,2132057084],"filter_matches":["hba"],"rank":19011,"citation_count":169,"estimated_citation_count":235,"publication_date":"2007-06-20","found_in":1},

We use the technique of value-function transfer where general features are extracted from the state space of a previous game and matched with the completely different state space of a new game. To capture the underlying similarity of vastly disparate state spaces arising from different games, we use a game-tree lookahead structure for features. We show that such feature-based value function transfer learns superior policies faster than a reinforcement learning agent that does not use knowledge transfer. Furthermore, knowledge transfer using lookahead features can capture opponent-specific value-functions, i.e. can exploit an opponent&#039;s weaknesses to learn faster than a reinforcement learner that uses lookahead with minimax (pessimistic) search against the same opponent.","url":"http://ijcai.org/Proceedings/07/Papers/107.pdf","lang":"en","authors":[2147180669,2162022237],"fos":[167573328,73795354,41008148,154945302,202556891,2780617750,14642086,119857082,102234262,47175762,170828538],"journals":[],"conferences":[2793510348],"conference_series":[1203999783],"references":[47250057,1515851193,2041367235,2099587183,2111572265,2121863487,2126565096,2145943363,2964331425],"filter_matches":["glgt"],"rank":19380,"citation_count":79,"estimated_citation_count":103,"publication_date":"2007-01-06","found_in":1},

Such generalization can both reduce planning time and allow us to tackle larger domains than the ones tractable for direct planning. In this paper, we present an approach to the generalization problem based on a new framework of relational Markov Decision Processes (RMDPs). An RMDP can model a set of similar environments by representing objects as instances of different classes. In order to generalize plans to multiple environments, we define an approximate value function specified in terms of classes of objects and, in a multiagent setting, by classes of agents. This class-based approximate value function is optimized relative to a sampled subset of environments, and computed using an efficient linear programming method. We prove that a polynomial number of sampled environments suffices to achieve performance close to the performance achievable when optimizing over the entire space. Our experimental results show that our method generalizes plans successfully to new, significantly larger, environments, with minimal loss of performance relative to environment-specific planning. We demonstrate our approach on a real strategic computer war game.","url":"http://www.ijcai.org/Past%20Proceedings/IJCAI-2003/PDF/144.pdf","lang":"en","authors":[1988556028,2167404190,2283966317,2290440925],"fos":[2993270172,41008148,106189395,41045048,119857082,154945302,126255220,14646407,177148314],"journals":[],"conferences":[2792991336],"conference_series":[1203999783],"references":[11088338,41895731,1515851193,1557798492,1560550898,1631187438,1654728867,1800916125,1967346767,2020149918,2040766536,2096600060,2096622112,2110111529,2121517924,2121863487,2134779831,2149385746,2158479468],"filter_matches":["per"],"rank":19050,"citation_count":149,"estimated_citation_count":226,"publication_date":"2003-08-09","found_in":1},

Our new method extends a recent advice-giving technique, called Knowledge-Based Kernel Regression (KBKR), that accepts advice concerning a single action of a reinforcement learner. In KBKR, users can say that in some set of states, an action&#039;s value should be greater than some linear expression of the current state. In our new technique, which we call Preference KBKR (Pref-KBKR), the user can provide advice in a more natural manner by recommending that some action is preferred over another in the specified set of states. Specifying preferences essentially means that users are giving advice about policies rather than Q values, which is a more natural way for humans to present advice. We present the motivation for preference advice and a proof of the correctness of our extension to KBKR. In addition, we show empirical results that our method can make effective use of advice on a novel reinforcement-learning task, based on the RoboCup simulator, which we call Breakaway. Our work demonstrates the significant potential of advice-giving techniques for addressing complex reinforcement learning problems, while further demonstrating the use of support-vector regression for reinforcement learning.","url":"https://experts.umn.edu/en/publications/giving-advice-about-preferred-actions-to-reinforcement-learners-v","lang":"en","authors":[738944226,2047441381,2079278047,2120363087,2464448550],"fos":[41008148,97541855,67203356,55439883,154945302,200695384,83546350,119857082],"journals":[],"conferences":[2785841295],"conference_series":[1184914352],"references":[193428430,1497976081,1511354083,1515851193,1584120419,1617610651,1976115983,2093404847,2121863487,2134289401,2140584963,2141559645,2145739724,2155791599,3022194887],"filter_matches":["apa"],"rank":19317,"citation_count":82,"estimated_citation_count":118,"publication_date":"2005-07-09","found_in":1},
